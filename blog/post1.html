                <p>A home lab can be very useful for someone looking to get into cyber security. From setting up vulnerable machines to practice you ethical hacking skills or Wazuh to monitor logs. There are many different ways to setup a home lab and one is not better than the other. It is how you choose to use your lab that matters.</p>
                
                <h3>What is a home lab?</h3>
                <p>A home lab can be a device or multiple devices that you use to practice or learn new skills within the realm of computer technology. This can be networking, pentesting, and/or dealing with the physical hardware itself. A home lab is a great way to refine and define skills you are actively looking to learn.</p>
                
                <h3>My Clustered Setup</h3>
                <p>Components I am using are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Raspberry Pi 3b x 2</li>
                    <li>Raspberry Pi 4b x 2</li>
                    <li>D-Link 8  port unmanaged switch</li>
                    <li>3 Feet Ethernet cables x 5</li>
                    <li>Internal SSD Adapter</li>
                    <li>500 GB Internal Samsung SSD</li>
                    <li>128 GB micro SD</li>
                </ul>
                <p><br>The goal is to use the home lab to monitor my network and devices. I plan to work towards a career on the blue team side and hence have setup my home lab to reflect my goal. We will create an 4 node cluster that will be managed by a switch.</p>
                <h3>Configure Raspberry Pi</h3>
                <p>We will use Raspberry Pi Imager tool to put the latest image onto a 128GB flash drive (You can get away with 32 GB). During this stage we can edit the settings such as setting a hostname (pi-cluster), username (pi or any other username), password (the more secure the better), wireless LAN, and finally enable SSH (port 22).</p>

                <h3>Build the Head Node</h3>
                <p>The head node was setup to connect to our local network. This will make it so we can just ssh right into it rather then setting up a keyboard, mouse and monitor.</p>

                <h3>Examples of Home Lab Projects</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wuzah SEIM/Log Management</li>
                    <li>Vulnerable Machine to Pentest</li>
                    <li>Nessus/OpenVAS for Vulnerability Assessment</li>
                    <li>OWASP Juice Shop</li>
                    <li>DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And there are far more projects you can do.</p>
                
                
                <div class="conclusion">
                    <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
                    <p>Creating a home lab is a great way to gain experience with tools, systems, networks, and/or fundamentals. It can expand your reservoir of knowledge and be an essential tool when it comes to building and growing your skills as a cyber security enthusiast.</p>
