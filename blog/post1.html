                <!-- Add an image of the cluster itself here. Doesn't have to be fancy or clean -->
                
                <p>A home lab can be very useful for someone looking to get into cyber security. From setting up vulnerable machines to practice you ethical hacking skills or Wazuh to monitor logs. There are many different ways to setup a home lab and one is not better than the other. It is how you choose to use your lab that matters.</p>
                
                <h3>What is a home lab?</h3>
                <p>A home lab can be a device or multiple devices that you use to practice or learn new skills within the realm of computer technology. This can be networking, pentesting, and/or dealing with the physical hardware itself. A home lab is a great way to refine and define skills you are actively looking to learn.</p>
                
                <h3>My Clustered Setup</h3>
                <p>Components I am using are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Raspberry Pi 3b x 2</li>
                    <li>Raspberry Pi 4b x 2</li>
                    <li>D-Link 8  port unmanaged switch</li>
                    <li>3 Feet Ethernet cables x 5</li>
                    <li>Internal SSD Adapter</li>
                    <li>500 GB Internal Samsung SSD</li>
                    <li>128 GB micro SD</li>
                </ul>
                <p><br>The goal is to use the home lab to monitor my network and devices. I plan to work towards a career on the blue team side and hence have setup my home lab to reflect my goal. We will create an 4 node cluster that will be managed by a switch.<br></p>
                <h3>Configure Raspberry Pi</h3>
                <p>We will use Raspberry Pi Imager tool to put the latest image onto a 128GB flash drive (You can get away with 32 GB). During this stage we can edit the settings such as setting a hostname (pi-cluster), username (pi or any other username), password (the more secure the better), wireless LAN, and finally enable SSH (port 22).<br></p>

                <h3>Building the Head Node</h3>
                <p>The head node was setup to connect to our local network. This will make it so we can just ssh right into it rather then setting up a keyboard, mouse and monitor. The setup will also depend on the components we have. To make it easy to find we want our head node to be the top node (When I upgrade the lab it will be most left). This way we know it is the head node as its the top of the stack. We will need two ethernet cables, usb to ethernet adapter, internal SSD adapter, and a SSD.<br><br></p>

                <p>During setup we configured the head node settings to connect wirelessly to the network. We should just be able to SSH directly into it using the username and password. We can use the command nmcli to display the current network configuration. We can plug in an ethernet cable from the Raspberry Pi to the network switch we will use for connecting the rest of the nodes. We should see that the ETH0 is disconnected which is alright. We will turn our head node into a DHCP server that will assign IP addresses to our other nodes.<br><br></p>

                <p>As we are using our clustered server we may need to transfer large files to and from our server. It would be best if we can setup a wired connection from the Raspberry Pi to our network. We can use the USB to ethernet dongle and setup a ETH1 connection as ETH0 will be used for our other nodes. After plugging in the adapter and connecting it to our network we can see the following added when executing the command nmcli.<br></p>

                <div class="tips">
                    <h4>Challenge 1</h4>
                    <p>I ran into problems with the raspberry pi 4 not connecting to the internet using wireless. To get around this I plugged in the ethernet to USB dongle and that seemed to work. We were going to use the dongle regardless as we may be transfering larger files and it would be faster over the ethernet.</p>
                </div>

                <img src="../images/nmcli-image.png" alt="ETH0 view using command nmcli in the raspberry pi terminal." class="post-image">

                <p>Internally we can setup the ETH0 and allocate 192.168.50.0/24 address for our cluster. Our head node taking the IP address 192.168.50.1 to make it easy to remember. To do this we can run the following commands on the head node. If everything goes to plan then the next steps are to configure the DHCP server.<br></p>

                <img src="../images/nmcli-con-du.png" alt="ETH0 setting the IP address and brining ETH0 down and back up." class="post-image">

                <h3>Configure the DHCP server</h3>

                <p>It is time to turn our head node into a DHCP server. To do this we should first install the DHCP server itself on the head node. To do this we can run the following command.<br></p>

                <div class="tips">
                    <h4>Challenge 2</h4>
                    <p>I ran into trouble with the eth0 not being activated. I did some digging and thought that maybe it was because the firmware needed an update or that I just needed to put eth0 in the up state. However, a far simplier and the fix for myself was using a different ethernet cable.</p>
                </div>

                <img src="../images/install-dhcp.png" alt="Command to install the DHCP service." class="post-image">

                <p>Once we have it installed we can then edit the /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf file. We will need to add lines for the internal cluster and the head node specifically.<br></p>

                <img src="../images/dhcpd-conf.png" alt="The dhcpd.conf file after the edits have been made." class="post-image">

                <p>We now have it setup so that unknown hosts will be allocated an IP Address when they connect to the switch. My switch is unmanaged so I need to wait until I connect my first node in order to see if this has worked. We have set it up so that new devices will get an IP Address starting at 192.168.50.20 and moving forward rather than getting a random one.<br><br></p>

                <h3>Adding the External SSD</h3>
                <p>Now we are going to add an external SSD to store the operating system and files the cluster may use. We will also have to make sure that the cluster has access to the attached SSD to the head node.<br><br></p>

                <p>We will create a single ext4 partition on the disk and format with a GUID partition table. This will give the raspberry pi's enough space during boot. We can achieve this with the following commands:<br></p>

                <img src="../images/partition-ssd-commands.png" alt="Commands to partition the SSD drive connected to the head node." class="post-image">

                <p>We can then manually mount the disk and check to make sure that everything is working properly. We can then make sure it will automatically mount at boot by adding the following to /etc/fstab file.<br></p>

                <div class="tips">
                    <h4>Tip 1</h4>
                    <p>Make sure to manuallly test if the disk will mount before adding it to the fstab file. If you add and do not test it there is potential for the OS to hang at boot. This is due to the disk not mounting properly or is not available.</p>
                </div>

                <img src="../images/ssd-mount.png" alt="Commands to mount the SSD." class="post-image">

                <h3>Disk Useable by the Cluster</h3>

                <p>To make the new SSD available across the cluster we need to install the NFS server. This tool will allow the sharing of the mount point based on IP address. To achieve this we can run the following commands to install, create a moint point to share, and share the mount point over the network.<br></p>

                <!-- We need to add the a picture of making the SSD available to the cluster -->

                <p>Finally we can then start both rpcbind and nfs-server and reboot. Like that the head node has been created and is ready to go. Next we need to creat our first node and then add the other 2 nodes following a similar process.<br><br></p>


                <!--
                <h3>Node Setup</h3>

                <p>Setting up the head node took a lot of steps. If you have fallen asleep its time to wake up again for the last couple steps we need to do. The process for all the other nodes we are adding are very similar save maybe an extra step or two for the first node we add. This makes it easier to setup each node and hopefully less boring.<br><br></p>

                <p>Unlike the first one we can create a image to boot from with only SSH enabled. We can remove the settings to add the wireless connection from the image. We will setup the Raspberry Pi to boot using the network however, we want to boot using the head node rather than wirelessly.<br></p>

                <div class="tips">
                    <h4>Tip 2</h4>
                    <p>In the settings see if you can disable the wlan while setting up the boot image.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Plug the ethernet from the node to the switch and then boot the raspberry pi. The board should come up and be visible under the dhcp-lease-list. This way we can check and make sure that the DHCP is able to assign the nodes an IP address and that our DHCP server is working. We can then ssh into the new board and enable network booting.<br><br></p>

                    <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
                    <p>Creating a home lab is a great way to gain experience with tools, systems, networks, and/or fundamentals. It can expand your reservoir of knowledge and be an essential tool when it comes to building and growing your skills as a cyber security enthusiast.<br><br>It can also be difficult to setup so patience is a key element. Problem solve and work through the problem. Then add it to a playbook so if it happens next time you are ready.</p>
